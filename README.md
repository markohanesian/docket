## User Story
Gaming is one of my favorite pastimes with friends. I would like to keep a current list of our favorite games to play so that we can make a quick decision on what to play when we get together. I need a streamlined app that will allow me to view, add, and delete games from the docket.

## Instructions
Add games you want to play into the input box and click the "add game" button to add them to the list - remove games by clicking the trash icon
